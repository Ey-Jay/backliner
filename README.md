# Backliner

Backliner is an app to help artists manage their workflow and centralize their online services. It's a data storage that holds bookmarks to all the files a band needs to keep track off, gives users the option of sorting them by project and comes with a fully functional lyrics editor. Optionally, bands can connect the Google Account of their band to integrate their Google Calendar right into the app. Backliner also comes with its own band chat.
